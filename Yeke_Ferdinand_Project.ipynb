    "With my interpertation of the model, it seems to perform extremely well. \n",
    "-    Starting off with the confusion matrix (normalized), on the true negatives, the model predicted 94% respondants did not had a heart attack, and the model was right on that part. On the False Positives, the model predicted that 0.011% of respondants had a heart attack, and the model was actually incorrect on that. On the False negatives, the model predicted that 0.041% did not had a heart attack, and the model was incorrect on that, where 0.041% did. ON the True Positives, the model predicted that 0.013% had a heart attack, and the model was right.\n",
    "-    Next is the accuracy. First, the precision score of this model is at 96% at false, and 54% true. The Recall score of this model is at 99% for false, and 23% true. The F1-Score of this model is at 97% false and 33% true, **giving a total accuracy at 95%**, which for a model on medical data, seems good.\n",
    "-    For the predictions, the model seems reasonable with the predictions like in case 1 in how in poor health the person is, they are much more likely to have heart disease. Also, like in person 2 and 3, they were way more active, and even when person 3 had health condtions like suffering from a stroke and being a formal smoker, they were still active and tried to have a active and healthy lifestyle.\n",
    "-    Overall, I think the model performed very well with good accuracy and reasonable predictions.\n"
